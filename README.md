# Bulls And Cows

Welcome to the Bulls and Cows game! You must chooses a secret code of 4 digits from 0 â€“ 9, with all digits being different. The objective is for you to guess the AI's secret code and the AI to guess your secret code.

## Overview

**Objective**: Guess the opponent's secret 4-digit code by deducing the correct sequence of digits.

**Guessing**: On each turn, players present their guesses for the opponent's secret code.

**Feedback**: After each guess, the opponent provides feedback in terms of "bulls" and "cows":

- A "bull" indicates a correct digit in the correct position.
- A "cow" indicates a correct digit in a different position.


**AI Difficulty Levels**:

- Easy AI: The AI generates random valid guesses.
- Medium AI: The AI avoids repeating previous guesses.
- Hard AI: The AI uses an intelligent strategy to optimise guessing.

**Saving Results**: After the game, you can choose to save the results to a text file. The saved file includes:

- Player and computer's secret numbers.
- Each guess made during the game, along with its result (bulls & cows).
- Identity of the winner or a draw message.

**Wordle Variation**: In addition to Bulls and Cows, you can also choose to play Wordle. In this variation, you have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. The computer does not participate in this version.
